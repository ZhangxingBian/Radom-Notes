## Tips on Submission

Dual submission 双重提交？？？

正文部分不能超过8页，引用部分长度不限。

The camera ready copy should not contain a ruler. (uncomment the'\iccvfinalcopy' command in the document preamble.)

Blind review means that you do not use the words ``my or  our'' when citing previous work.  

For conference submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not require the reviewer to go to a techreport for further details. you may say in the body of the paper ``further details may be found in~\cite{Authors14b}''.  Then submit the techreport as additional material. Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material.

Are acknowledgements OK? No.  Leave them for the final copy.

## Tips on Formatting

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a **sentence-ending space**. So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.  The provided '\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using  et alia, shortened to ``\etal'' . However, use it only when there are three or more authors.

If you use the '\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.

*For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not chronological) order, so prefer \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors14} to \cite{Alpher02,Alpher03,Authors14}.* 注意作者之间只用逗号分隔而没有空格

Number page correctly. Pages are numbered in submission mode, and unnumbered in camera-ready.

> “Camera-ready” copy refers to the final stage of text, tables, and illustrations of a manuscript and includes proper formatting. What is submitted as camera ready is printed as it is with no revisions. 

Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word)大写名词，代词，动词，形容词和副词的第一个字母; 不要将冠词，连词或介词大写（除非标题以这样的词开头）

> coordinating conjunctions: And, but, for, nor, or, so, and yet—these are the seven.

All paragraphs should be indented 1 pica (approx. 1/6 inch or 0.422 cm)

If you require a third-order heading (**we discourage it**), use 10-point Times, boldface, initially capitalized, flush left, preceded by one blank line, **followed by a period and your text on the same line**.

Please use footnotes\footnote sparingly.  It often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.
Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral observations(评论) in the text (within **parentheses**, if you prefer, as in this sentence).

Resize fonts *in figures to match the font in the body text*, and choose line widths which render effectively in print.  Many readers (and reviewers) will choose to print your paper in order to read it.  You must not assume that they can zoom in to see tiny details on a graphic.

You must include your signed IEEE copyright release form when you submit your finished paper. We MUST have this form before your paper can be published in the proceedings.

## How to Writing an Equation

**Math is prose.**  End a displayed equation with a punctuation mark. Write  equations with signposts as to tell readers how they got which from what. Acquiring the habit of viewing an equation not as a grammatically irrelevant blob, but as a part of the text fully deserving of punctuation, can only improve the fluency and grace of one's expository mathematical prose.

**Fisher's rule.** Number all equations.

**The Good Samaritan Rule.** Add explanatory text. When referring to an equation identify it by a phrase as well as a number.

- Bad one: "inserting (2.47) and (3.51) into (5.13)..." 

- Good one:  "inserting the form (2.47) of the electric field E and the Lindhard form (3.51) of the dielectric function e  into the constitutive equation (5.13)"

If the nature of the equation is inherently uncharacterizable in a compact phrase, is the cross-reference really necessary? Indeed, is the equation itself essential? Or is it the kind of nasty and fundamentally uninteresting intermediate step that readers would either skip over or, if seriously interested, work out for themselves, in neither case needing to have it appear in your text? If so, drop it.
